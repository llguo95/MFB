    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of scripts was written to facilitate multi-output or multi-fidelity regression and Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes. It is built from elements of the `GPy`, `emukit` and `gpytorch/botorch` packages.\n",
    "The core structure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cokgj.py` contains a wrapper class that injects the cokg-j implementation of `emukit` into the `botorch` framework.\n",
    "- `main.py` contains functions to run the regression and optimization experiments. Read `readme.txt` for more information about the in- and outputs of these functions. It relies heavily on `pipeline.py`.\n",
    "- `MFproblem.py` contains the class for initializing 2-fidelity problem objects. This class has methods which can: \n",
    "    - generate DoE input data (both low and high fidelity) for the problem.\n",
    "    - initialize the appropriate GP model given `model_type`.\n",
    "    - initialize the appropriate acquisition function depending on fidelity type.\n",
    "    - optimize the acquisition function.\n",
    "- `objective_formatter.py`contains two classes:\n",
    "    - `botorch_TestFunction`, a wrapper class that injects a `pybench` `function` into the shape of a `botorch` `SyntheticTestFunction`.\n",
    "    - `AugmentedTestFunction`, a class that facilitates the augmentation of a `SyntheticTestFunction` object with a `LF` parameter, effectively creating a multi-fidelity objective out of a single-fidelity objective.\n",
    "- `pipeline.py` contains functions which, as a whole, construct and process the DoE data and return the relevant predictive means and variances. They are subdivided into `pretrainer`, `trainer` and `posttrainer` parts."
